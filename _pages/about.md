title: Why Models by Mike?

I think Facebook's 3D post feature is really cool, but creating 3D content is hard to do. I've spent many hours learning how to use 3D software and I am by no means an expert. The purpose of Models by Mike is to give everyone the ability to take advantage of 3D posts.

Everything on here is free to use for whatever purpose. I've benefitted from free software and from other free resources, so this is part of my way of giving back. If you want to support this page, you can support me on Patreon.
