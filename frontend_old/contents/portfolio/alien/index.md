The infamous alien. What started as a learning experience ended as a meme. I actually didn't model the alien myself, it's a public domain model I downloaded [from Blend Swap](https://www.blendswap.com/blend/8117). And the animation comes from Mixamo, although I did loop it in Blender.

I never expected the twerking alien to be so popular, but it was turned into a meme by someone and just exploded on Snapchat and Tiktok. I next decided to take the "Naruto runner" idea from the Raid Area 51 event and have the alien do that.
