I finished my website redesign! Originally I was focusing on making 3D models for Facebook posts, but then Facebook decided to discontinue 3D models in posts. So now I'm focusing on Snapchat lenses!

I am planning on providing brief breakdowns of each lens I make, and maybe the occasional in-depth look.
