Thanks for stopping by the website! I make Snapchat lenses because I have a ton of fun doing it, but if you wouldn't mind, a little support goes a long way.

The first way you can support me is just by subscribing to me on Snapchat. You can find me under the username "modelsbymike3d" or by checking out [my creator page here](https://lensstudio.snapchat.com/creator/Jn6NTlPetl3Iqtkd8MTNXQ).

Second, you can consider supporting me on Patreon. Patreon is a great way to connect creators with their community. Even a $1 a month contribution will help. Clicking the button below will take you my Patreon.

The third way is to buy some merch from me. ;) I've been turning some of my work into T-shirts and other related merchandise that you can find and purchase on Teespring. My store can [be viewed here](https://teespring.com/stores/models-by-mike).
