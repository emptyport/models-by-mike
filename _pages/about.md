title: Why Models by Mike?
permalink: /about/
---

I think Facebook's 3D post feature is really cool, but creating 3D content is hard to do. I've spent many hours learning how to use 3D software and I am by no means an expert. The purpose of Models by Mike is to give everyone the ability to take advantage of 3D posts.

All content on this site is licensed as [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/); everything on here is free to use for whatever purpose. 

To summarize:
 * You can use these models for any purpose, including commercial work
 * No credit is required, but I would definitely appreciate it
 * You can redistribute these models
 * However, you cannot claim to be the original creator of these models

I've benefitted from free software and from other free resources, so this is part of my way of giving back. If you want to support me in my endeavor, you can support me on Patreon.
